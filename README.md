## Introduction
This project involves an exploratory data analysis of the Lending Club dataset. The objective is to uncover insights about loan characteristics, borrower profiles, and the factors that contribute to loan defaults.

## Data
The dataset used in this analysis includes information about loans issued by Lending Club, including loan amounts, interest rates, grades, borrower details, and loan status.

## Analysis
The analysis is performed using the following Python libraries:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: For basic plotting and visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced data visualization.

### Key Findings:
#### Amount Categories Distribution
- All four amount categories exhibit similar distribution shapes.
- Most loan amounts range from $5,000 to $15,000.

#### Annual Income
- Annual incomes mostly range from $40,000 to $80,000.
- Higher annual incomes correlate with:
  - Larger loans
  - Higher revolving balances
  - Higher total payments

#### Interest Rates
- Interest rates primarily fall between 9-14%.
- Higher interest rates (20%-25%) result in more charge-offs.
- Interest rates decrease with longer employee tenure.
- Higher delinquencies and recent credit inquiries are linked to higher interest rates.

#### Debt Consolidation
- Debt consolidation is the most common loan purpose, with many charged-off loans linked to it.
- Loans for debt consolidation are the most common.

#### Loan Amounts and Correlations
- Loan amount, funding amount, and funded amount invested are highly correlated.
- Larger loans lead to higher total payments.
- Loans between $20,000 and $25,000 have higher charge-off rates.
- Higher loan amounts and interest rates are linked to higher charge-offs.
- Longer loan terms (60 months) have higher loan amounts.
- More inquiries are associated with larger loan amounts.

#### Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)
- High debt-to-income (DTI) ratios are linked to high revolving balances.
- Higher DTI loans are more likely to be charged off.
- Higher DTI loans have more defaulters, especially in educational and small business loans.

#### Loan Purpose and Defaults
- Small business loans have the highest charge-off rates.
- Wedding loans have the least charge-offs.
- Small business loans have the highest number of defaulters, followed by educational loans.
- House loan defaulters are higher in rented houses.
- Small business loan defaulters are higher among those who own homes.
- Education and housing loans are fewer.

#### Loan Grades and Default Risks
- Loans with Grade A and Sub Grade A have the lowest charge-off risks.
- Grades/Sub Grades F and G have the highest charge-off risks.

#### Employment and Charge-Offs
- Unemployed individuals or those with less than one year of experience are more likely to be charged off.

#### Geographic and Bankruptcy Insights
- States like New York, California, and Florida have high charge-off rates.
- Those with public record bankruptcies have higher charge-off percentages.

#### Interest Rate and Loan Types
- Small Business and Debt Consolidation loans charge higher interest rates.
- Car loans charge less interest.
- Higher charged-off ratios indicate higher interest rates.

#### Historical and Income Group Insights
- Defaulters are more common in years like 2007 and 2009.
- Small business loan defaulters span all annual income groups.
- Higher-income groups see more house and education loan defaulters.
- Higher loan amounts see more defaulters across categories.
- All loan defaulters are fewer when interest rates are low and higher when rates are high.

#### Charge-Off Trends
- As annual income increases, loan amounts and interest rates also increase, leading to more charge-offs.

## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the factors affecting loan defaults. It highlights the importance of borrower profiles and loan characteristics in determining the likelihood of charge-offs.

## Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run the analysis:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

## Usage
To reproduce the analysis:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required packages.
3. Open `M_Mangaiyarkarasi.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the notebook cells to perform the analysis.
